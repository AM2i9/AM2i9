### print("Hello World") üëã

I'm a guy with a love for computers. I mostly do backend-type stuff using Python, but sometimes I try to branch into other languages, such as JavaScript or TypeScript. I also have some experience in C, Java, Lua, and of course JavaScript and TypeScript.

I also have experience with running Linux systems. A few of my projects are self-hosted in my basement.

I tend to make little programs and scripts, which you can see in [my gists](https://gist.github.com/AM2i9)
